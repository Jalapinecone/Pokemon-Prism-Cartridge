# Pokemon-Prism-Cartridge

This is a 3d printable custom cartridge for making a physical copy of the romhack Pokemon Prism. This model is a modified version of a GameBoy cartridge STL found at https://cdn.thingiverse.com/zipfiles/eb/cd/a9/44/51/Game_Boy_Cartridge.zip

So far the print is untested since I don't have a 3d printer, but it should be the right dimensions
